# Adversarial Apps Mobile App

This is the Mobile App Component for our product.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application.

To Deploy to our Mobile App Playground, simply put in this command.
Note: Do Not Run this unless it is working on mobile.
```
make deploy OUTPUT=Adversarial-Apps-Mobile-Playground
```

To determine issues with your flutter setup, run the following:
```
flutter doctor
```

Most likely, your Visual Studio is not configured correctly. Most commonly this is due to a missing package.
